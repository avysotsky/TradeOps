# Development Orchestration

## Purpose

This directory is the cross-chat source of truth for parallel development.

Chat history is not the coordination mechanism. GitHub branches, commits, CI and these status files are.

## Current baseline

TradeOps repository:

```text
avysotsky/TradeOps
main product integration: eb6cdf9c3e8b111a85e0d44d170718527eaf9d40
latest integrated workstream: WS-04 — Event-driven Backtester (PR #52)
previous integrated workstreams: WS-02 PR #51, WS-01 PR #50, WS-03 PR #49
```

DocFlow repository:

```text
avysotsky/DocFlow
branch: DocFlow/v_1.1.1.34_AccountingPosting
validated sandbox-readiness head: c03e71f0a2c1c4ae414c083fc1f53a6351c3b4bf
status: HOLD / maintenance unless business priority changes
```

## Current product objective

Prepare a demonstrable long-horizon stock research-to-execution workflow for the prospective Upwork use case:

```text
company universe
-> earnings / filings / transcripts
-> structured research facts
-> ResearchDecision
-> deterministic portfolio/risk translation
-> TradeOps
-> Interactive Brokers Paper
```

Do not position this as an alpha-generation or guaranteed-profit system.

## Shared contract boundary

TradeOps v2.6.0.0 freezes the first shared contract:

```text
InstrumentReference
ResearchDecision
ResearchDecisionAction
ResearchDecisionValidationResult
```

Canonical code lives in:

```text
src/TradeOps.Application/Models/InstrumentReference.cs
src/TradeOps.Application/Models/ResearchDecision.cs
src/TradeOps.Application/Models/ResearchDecisionValidationResult.cs
src/TradeOps.Application/Services/ResearchDecisionValidator.cs
```

Worker branches must not change this v1 contract without an explicit orchestrator decision.

## Workstreams

| ID | Workstream | Branch | State | Can run now |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WS-01 | IBKR Paper Adapter | TradeOps/ws01-ibkr-paper-adapter | INTEGRATED_READ_ONLY | real Paper smoke / mutation slice later |
| WS-02 | Earnings Intelligence / research integration | TradeOps/ws02-earnings-intelligence-contract | INTEGRATED | no further contract changes without orchestration |
| WS-03 | Signal / Portfolio Target Engine | TradeOps/ws03-signal-portfolio-engine | INTEGRATED | no further contract changes without orchestration |
| WS-04 | Event-driven Backtester | TradeOps/ws04-backtester-contracts | INTEGRATED | bounded v1 complete; no generic expansion without orchestration |
| DF-01 | DocFlow QBO | avysotsky/DocFlow / v1.1.1.34 | HOLD | no, unless reprioritized |

## Dependency graph

```

WS-01 read-only boundary is integrated by PR #50. Real authenticated Paper validation remains a hard gate before enabling order mutations.

WS-02 semantic alignment is resolved and integrated by PR #51. Earnings assessment now maps through explicit EarningsTargetWeightPolicy into ResearchDecision(Action = SetTargetWeight), compatible with integrated WS-03.

WS-03 RebalancePlan / RebalanceOrderIntent v1 semantics are integrated by PR #49 and are now the downstream portfolio-planning boundary.

WS-04 bounded v1 is integrated by PR #52 and reuses the integrated WS-02 event-time semantics and WS-03 planner semantics. Do not expand it into a generic research project unless required by the client-facing vertical slice.

## Integration order

1. DONE — merge orchestration layer.
2. DONE — WS-03 target-weight/rebalance planning contract (PR #49).
3. DONE — WS-01 paper-only IBKR read boundary (PR #50); real Paper smoke remains a gate before mutation capability.
4. DONE — WS-02 semantic alignment and earnings/event-time contract integrated (PR #51).
5. DONE — historical event/provenance and SetTargetWeight boundaries frozen for downstream replay.
6. DONE — WS-04 bounded event-driven backtester integrated (PR #52).
7. NEXT — assemble client-ready vertical slice: earnings event -> explicit client rule/policy -> SetTargetWeight -> historical backtest -> rebalance output.
8. In parallel, perform real authenticated IBKR Paper read-path smoke before mutation work.
9. After Paper validation, build RebalanceOrderIntent -> existing risk/order lifecycle -> IBKR Paper mutation bridge.
10. End-to-end client demo: earnings/research -> backtest -> target weight -> rebalance -> IBKR Paper.

## Ownership / merge-conflict rules

### Orchestrator owns

```text
docs/orchestration/**
cross-workstream contract decisions
integration order
merge readiness
priority changes
```

### WS-01 owns

IBKR-specific adapter, provider configuration, instrument resolution, paper-account reads/order lifecycle and IBKR tests.

It must not implement earnings parsing or portfolio strategy logic.

### WS-02 owns

Research/earnings source ingestion contract and transformation into the frozen TradeOps ResearchDecision boundary.

The actual transcript/filing ingestion service should remain a separate bounded context. Do not turn TradeOps into an LLM/document-ingestion application.

### WS-03 owns

Deterministic translation from validated ResearchDecision / target weights into portfolio/rebalance plans and risk-aware execution intents.

It must not call an LLM or fetch earnings data.

### WS-04 owns

Historical event replay, timestamp correctness, look-ahead-bias prevention, portfolio simulation and evaluation metrics.

It must not define a second production decision contract.

## State machine

```text
PLANNED
-> READY
-> IN_PROGRESS
-> VALIDATION
-> READY_FOR_INTEGRATION
-> INTEGRATED
-> DONE
```

`BLOCKED` can be entered from any pre-integration state with a named dependency.

## Worker completion protocol

Every worker must update its own status file before asking for integration.

Required fields:

```text
State
Branch
Current HEAD
Completed
Public/shared contracts changed
Tests
CI run + conclusion
Blockers
Next integration action
```

A worker may not claim DONE solely because local tests pass. CI or an explicit orchestrator waiver is required.

## Orchestrator review protocol

On each "continue" or "check status":

1. fetch current main heads for TradeOps and DocFlow;
2. fetch each active worker branch HEAD;
3. compare each worker branch with its base/main;
4. inspect current CI;
5. read changed workstream status files;
6. identify dependency changes or overlapping files;
7. choose which workstreams continue, block, or integrate;
8. update this file only when the plan/status materially changes.

## Current priority

```text
P0  client-ready vertical slice — connect integrated earnings, policy, backtest and rebalance flow
P0  WS-01 next validation — real authenticated IBKR Paper read-path smoke
DONE WS-04 Event-driven Backtester — PR #52
DONE WS-02 Earnings Intelligence boundary — PR #51
DONE WS-03 Portfolio Target & Rebalancing Engine — PR #49
DONE WS-01 IBKR Paper read boundary — PR #50
HOLD DocFlow QBO sandbox work
```
